Google Cloud Platform Kubernetes Cluster Terraform Module
Use this deployment to easily deploy a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)'s Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

In order to do so we need to have 4 files:
kubecluster-deployment.tf -- contains the definition of what we want to achieve

variables.tf -- contains the variables definition.

config.tfvars -- contains the values for variables.

service_account_key.json -- contains the service account key.

Create service account key
You have to create service_account_key.json inside the /root/Terraform-project/Kube-cluster-deployment before running which would contain your service Account Key file.

This contains your authentication required for Terraform to talk to the Google API.

You can get it under

Google Cloud Platform -> IAM & admin -> Service accounts -> Create service account -> attach role "Kubernetes Engine Admin" -> Create Key.
For the Key type field choose JSON format. Put the content of the downloaded file into "service_account_key.json" right there where your all deployment files are located which you use them to create Kubernetes Engine Cluster.
Create config.tfvars file
Create config.tfvars file with following content:

cluster_name            =    "example-name"
node_count              =    "2"                                
cpath                   =    "PATH/service_account_key.json"    # Path where ur service account key is located
project                 =    "example-240119"                   # Project_id
region                  =    "us-central1"                      # Region
node_name               =    "example"
Variables
variables.tf holds the definition of the elements that can be configured in your deployment script.

From now on every time you run a terraform commands {plan|apply|destroy|...} you will need to provide the required variables. Without further information terraform will enter an interactive mode requesting each variables one by one at the prompt.

If you do not want to set these values on every run you can create a file called config.tfvars which we already did.

Architecture
Now that we know what we want to build and also how we want to parametrize our script we are ready to build the kubecluster-deployment.tf The code snippets below are extracted from this file.

USAGE
Initialize working directory.
The first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration is the terraform init command in order to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. It is safe to run this command multiple times.

terraform init
Plan before Apply
We need to plan all changes before applying it. That`s why we need to run the following command:

terraform plan -var-file=config.tfvars Displays what would be executed

Deploy the changes by applying
For applying all changes we need to run the following command:

terraform apply -var-file=config.tfvars Applies the changes

Test the deploy.

When the terraform apply command completes, use the Google Cloud console, you should see the new Kubernetes Engine created one Cluster with 2 nodes.

Destroy all the changes
To destroy everything please run the following command:

terraform destroy -var-file=config.tfvars Destroy the changes.
